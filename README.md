## Hi there, I'm Max 👋
### 🎓 Aspiring JavaScript Developer | Lifelong Learner | Open-Source Enthusiast

I'm a self-taught developer passionate about writing code, solving problems, and learning new technologies. Currently, I am focused on honing my JavaScript and React skills through various online tutorials and projects.

#### 🌱 I'm currently learning:

- **React** - By taking a deeper dive into React, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of state management, life cycle methods, hooks, and more. I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects, contributing to more responsive, user-friendly web applications.
- **TypeScript** - I've already started integrating TypeScript into my current projects, pushing my boundaries and gaining practical experience. I firmly believe the best way to learn is by doing, and using TypeScript allows me to reinforce what I've learned while seeing immediate benefits in my code. I'm looking forward to exploring more TypeScript features and applying them in complex, real-world scenarios.
- **Responsive design** - To ensure my applications provide a seamless and user-friendly experience across devices, I'm focusing on learning and applying the principles of responsive design. I'm eager to create web applications that are not only functional and attractive, but truly accessible, no matter the device.
- **SQL** - Building dynamic, data-driven applications demands an understanding of databases and SQL. Recognizing this, I've been familiarizing myself with the basics of SQL, the standard language for relational database management systems. I've enjoyed working with SQLite and leveraging Prisma as an ORM for seamless data manipulation and integration into my projects, and am interested in following up by learning about other solutions such as PostgreSQL.

#### ☀️ Hobbies & interests:

- When I'm not coding, I enjoy diving into the world of art and music. In particular, I have a deep appreciation for music production. The process of layering sounds, harmonies, and rhythms is almost like building an application - it starts with individual elements, but the real magic happens when you bring them together to create a complete piece. 🎧
- Travel is my source of inspiration and rejuvenation - there's something uniquely satisfying about immersing myself in different cultures and environments. 🧳
- Sushi is more than just a favorite dish for me - it's a symbol of culinary precision and artistry that I also aim for in my coding projects. 🍣
- Always curious, I continue to explore the intersection of my diverse interests. For instance, I'm intrigued by the concept of AI-generated art - it's a fascinating example of how technology can unlock new dimensions of creativity. As I delve into more projects, I look forward to exploring these exciting crossovers. 🖼️
